# ngeen
ngeen is a video game engine. It is made with libGDX.

How to run:

Install first Java 8 and add it to your path.

Run the following command in the command prompt:

gradlew.bat desktop:run

This starts the engine as is. The files for data are in the folder android/assets.
If there are any saved scenes, they are in the android/assets/scenes.

Same for scripts.

This compiles the engine from source.

In order to use it properly, make sure you understand how it works first.

To change the current scene, either add objects from the xml file or from a scene.
More features will be added soon-ish. Have fun making games.
